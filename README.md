# MANA - A Community Directed Decentralized Price Prediction Market
--- --- ---

# Abstract
The concept of cryptocurrency has been in existence for around 40 years and has now become a significant asset for investors to consider. Cryptocurrencies enable tradable exchange without the involvement of a third party, leading many individuals to pursue cryptocurrency trading as a career. With tradable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more, it's increasingly possible for people with limited experience in cryptocurrency and investing to quickly acquire knowledge and skills in this field. This often leads to a deep interest in the financial markets. MANA is positioned as a platform for profitable trading and a community-driven marketplace. While other organizations have introduced features enabling users to make predictions and interact, MANA aims to welcome users of all experience levels to test their expertise. It's a place where users can vote on the price movements of cryptocurrencies.

# Project Overview
MANA is a decentralized platform leveraging blockchain technology to enable community-driven price predictions for various assets. Utilizing the MANA Token (MNAT), participants can vote on future price movements every two hours, stake their tokens, and earn rewards for accurate predictions. The MANA platform aims to harness collective intelligence for market analysis while providing all participants with a fair, transparent, and engaging experience. 

Price prediction is a valuable tool for traders and investors. Traditional methods often rely on expert analysis or algorithmic predictions, which can be biased or lack transparency. MANA offers a decentralized alternative, where community members contribute their insights to predict price movements, creating a collective intelligence that enhances market understanding.

# Voting Mechanism
Community members must submit their predictions on where the price of a specific asset will be every two hours. This continuous voting cycle ensures up-to-date and relevant predictions that reflect the latest market sentiments.

# Staking
To participate in voting, members must stake MNAT tokens. Staking serves as a commitment to their prediction and helps prevent spam or malicious activities. The amount staked reflects the voter's confidence in their prediction. By staking tokens, users contribute to a larger pool of staked tokens that are then distributed amongst voters with the most accuracy. To maximize potential gains, members will need to stake more tokens. In other words, the more you put in, the more you'll get out.

# Data Collection
The smart contract records all votes and the corresponding staked amounts, ensuring complete transparency and immutability of the voting process. This data is publicly accessible and verifiable by anyone. While the voting data is public, the identity of the voters remains pseudonymous, linked only to their wallet addresses, to maintain the utmost security and privacy possible. 

# Outcome Verification
At the end of each voting period (every two hours), an oracle retrieves the actual price data from a reliable source. The smart contract then verifies the outcome by comparing the actual price change to the community's predictions.

# Reward Distribution
Participants who make correct predictions about price movements receive rewards from the staked tokens. The rewards are distributed proportionally based on the amount staked, which encourages accurate predictions and active participation. Those who make incorrect predictions forfeit their staked tokens, which are then redistributed among the correct predictors.

# Security and Fairness
The smart contract ensures that the voting process is secure and tamper-proof. Utilizing a reliable oracle minimizes the risk of manipulation, maintaining the integrity of the prediction outcomes.

# Community Engagement
MANA aims to promote active community engagement by enabling members to actively participate in market predictions. This engagement not only provides valuable insights into market trends but also creates a gamified experience that is both educational and rewarding.

**Use Cases:**
1. Trading Signals: Traders can utilize the collective predictions as signals to inform their trading strategies.
2. Market Analysis: Analysts and researchers can use the aggregated data for market sentiment analysis.
3. Gamified Learning: Beginners in trading can learn about market dynamics in an engaging, low-risk environment.
